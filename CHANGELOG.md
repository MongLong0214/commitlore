# Changelog

## 0.1.0 — 2026-07-26

First release. Protocol v2.0.0.

### The protocol

Sixteen trailer keys, every one of them with a consumer route — a key nothing
reads does not enter the spec. `spec/SPEC.md` is canonical; an implementation
that passes `spec/fixtures/` (25 conformance fixtures) and
`spec/contract-cases/` (14 cases) is a conforming implementation in any
language.

Parsing is delegated to `git interpret-trailers`, never to line matching. Eight
boundary behaviours (B1–B8) are pinned by fixture, including the two that make
grepping wrong: prose containing a colon line yields **zero** trailers (B3), and
a trailer block with no subject line yields zero as well (B8).

### The CLI

`validate` `parse` `context` `limits` `ruled-out` `warnings` `stale` `index`
`doctor` `guard` `inject` `harvest` `harvest-verify` `squash-preserve`
`backfill` `hooks` `mcp`.

Exit codes are a contract: `0` clean, `1` the check found something, `2` usage
error. (`guard` overloads `2` for "matched" — documented, not accidental.)

- SQLite incremental index with a `--no-index` fallback that returns identical
  rows from git alone. Measured p50 **1.86ms** for a path-scoped query over a
  100k-commit repository, against a 100ms criterion; the fallback answers the
  same query in 105ms.
- Records survive rebase, amend, squash merge (`squash-preserve`) and rename
  (`--follow` by default), mirrored in `refs/notes/commitlore`.
- Trust grading: `Warn:` renders as an instruction only when provenance is
  `authored` and the committer is trusted. Everything else is a claim. Trust
  defaults to nobody.
- Secret scanning refuses to inject a record whose value looks like a live
  credential, redacted to four characters.

### For agents

`commitlore mcp` (stdio MCP server), a path-scoped and budgeted injection hook,
transcript harvesting with an evidence-checking verifier, and `guard` for
pre-tool-use blocking.

### Measured, and what is not

Every figure in the README is regenerated from `bench/results/` by
`bench/report.ts` and CI fails if one byte differs.

The re-proposal benchmark ran 60 registered runs against frozen code and came
back **without a significant difference**: `commitlore-on` 5/30, `commitlore-off`
7/30, Fisher exact two-tailed **p = 0.7480**. It is published rather than
withheld. Two documents say why it is weaker evidence than it looks:

- `bench/VERDICT-M1.md` — power to detect the observed effect at n=30/arm was
  **5.1%**, and 4 of 10 tasks were silent in both arms.
- `bench/ROUTE-GAP.md` — the matrix delivered `Ruled-out:` as injected context,
  which SPEC §5 assigns to `Limit:` and `Warn:`. The route §5 assigns to
  `Ruled-out:` is `guard`, and it was never invoked. Replaying the same runs
  through `guard` stops 3 of the 5 re-proposals before execution, at a
  false-alarm cost that has to be designed against.

CPAA is not measured: `harvest` carries no model by design, so no bench row
prices it, and `metrics.ts` reports `not-instrumented` rather than a number.
The `no-scope` ablation arm is inert because the bench injector never scoped.

### Known limits

- One model and one CLI version behind every behavioural figure.
- `guard` matches lexically, not semantically: it finds a revival that reuses
  the words, not one that paraphrases them.
- Node >= 22 (ADR-0010; Node 20 reached end of life 2026-04-30).
