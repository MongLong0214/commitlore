/**
 * Doctor command registration and output selection.
 *
 * This boundary owns Commander integration and choosing JSON versus the text
 * renderer, leaving diagnosis and formatting independently testable.
 *
 * `commitlore doctor` — is this repository able to carry and share records?
 *
 * The mirror in `refs/notes/commitlore` (ADR-0004) only reaches a teammate if
 * their clone is configured to fetch it, which git does not do by default. A
 * clone that skips that step reads an empty mirror and reports "no record" for
 * commits that have one — a silent wrong answer, the most expensive kind here.
 * doctor exists to turn that into a visible, fixable finding.
 *
 * Two boundaries are deliberate:
 *
 * - `--fix` only writes reversible local config (`remote.<name>.fetch`).
 *   Pushing notes is a network write to a shared ref, so doctor prints the
 *   command and lets a human run it.
 * - The commit-msg hook is *reported*, never installed. `commitlore hooks
 *   install` (T-202) owns that file; doctor only reads it.
 *
 * `checkSquashConservation` (ADR-0014, bug-issue-60 finding 1) is the same
 * shape of problem one route over: nothing runs `squash-preserve`
 * automatically, and a squash that happened without it silently drops
 * records the same way an unfetched mirror silently drops them. It is a
 * `doctor` check rather than a CI step because it runs at the moment the
 * mistake is still local and cheap to fix — see the check's own doc comment
 * for the full "Ruled-out" reasoning.
