 *
 * The third case is the reason this exists. `scanTrailers` read `git rev-parse

 * git was broken, absent, or not a repository at all produced
 * `{"records": [], "diagnostics": []}` and exit 0. That is the most dangerous
 * output this tool can produce: an agent reads "no constraints" as "nothing is
 * off limits", and here it was said with the same confidence as a genuine empty.
 *
 * `empty` is separated from `unavailable` deliberately. A freshly initialised
 * repository legitimately has nothing, and folding it into the failure case
 * would make `commitlore` refuse to run on the first commit of every project —
 * which trains people to ignore the failure that matters.
